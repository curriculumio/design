You see a problem that you think a device, an app, or an interface would be able to solve. Where do you begin? 
To understand a problem, first research it. While researching, address the following questions. 

- Who are you solving this problem for? You or for others? 
- Why is your problem a problem? What contributes to the problem?
- How do potential users interact with their environment? 
- How does this interaction give you insight about what they think and feel?
- What do they really need? 
- What values do they hold? 
- Has anybody attempted to solve this problem? If so, why were they successful or unsuccessful?

To answer these questions, in context to their daily lives, observe individuals and their behaviors. Have conversations with them and to develop their answers always ask “Why?”. Observe them complete tasks physically and have them talk to you through your steps. 

To gain a better understanding of users, you can: 
- Conduct interviews
  -  Interviews should be more of conversations. Develop answers by asking “why”
- Search the internet 
  - Read news articles, academic articles 
  - Use the advanced search
 
Design Research Activity - Build a survey
Come up with 10 questions that will inform you about users and the context of the problem. You can builid surveys in Google Docs.

1.) Build your survey to obtain important insights, so every question in the survey is necessary. It’s best to plan your survey by first identifying the data you need to collect and then writing your questions.

2.) Make your surveys short. Individuals are less likely to complete long surveys, or surveys that bounce around haphazardly from topic to topic. Make sure the survey follows a logical order and can be filled in reasonable time.

3.) Ask direct questions. Vaguely or poorly worded questions confuse respondents and make your data less useful. Strive for clear and precise language that will make your questions easy to answer.
