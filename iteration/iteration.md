Asking questions is a fundamental activity in Design. When design research is integrated into the
designing process, new and unexpected questions came emerge. This section explains how these new and unexpected questions
can fit into the design process also known as the iterative design process. 

Creating a game will serve as a practical model to understand the iterative design process. Games aim to delight individuals 
Video games make wonderful studies for design research through the process of design. As a game evolves 
,it defines and redefines its own form and the  experiences it can provide for players.
Through the iterative play of design itself, entirely new questions can come into being.

Iterative design is cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a work in progress. 
In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving 
a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented. Test; analyze; refine. And repeat.
Because the experience of a user cannot ever be completely predicted, 
in an iterative process design decisions are based on the experience of the prototype in progress. 

The prototype is tested, revisions are made, and the project is tested once more. In this way, the project develops through 
an ongoing dialogue between the designers, the design, and the testing audience. In the case of games, iterative design means 
playtesting. Throughout the entire process of design and development, your game is played. You play it.
The rest of the development team plays it. Other people in the office play it. People visiting your office play it. 
You organize groups of testers that match your target audience. You have as many people as possible play the game. 
In each case, you observe them, ask them questions, then adjust your design and playtest again. This iterative process of 
design is radically different than typical retail game development. More often than not, at the start of the design process 
for a computer or console title, a game designer will think up a finished concept and then write an exhaustive design
document that outlines every possible aspect of the game in minute detail. Invariably, the final game never resembles 
the carefully conceived original. A more iterative design process, on the other hand, will not only streamline development
resources, but will also result in a more robust and successful final product.
