Define

Now that you have gathered information, it is now time to define the problem that you are solving. Defining your problem 
brings direction towards the development process. To define problem, observe what stood out to you in your research. Were there
any patterns that emerged? If so, why did they emerge? Who is your user and what are their needs that you are trying to fulfill. 

To understand the root of the problem, follow the 5 “whys” exercise.
