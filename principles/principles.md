These principles of design guide designers to improve the quality of user centered design. Before you go through the process 
of design, it is important to understand the principles behind them.

The structure principle: Design should organize the user interface purposefully, in meaningful and useful ways based on clear,
consistent models that are apparent and recognizable to users, putting related things together and separating unrelated things,
differentiating dissimilar things and making similar things resemble one another. The structure principle is concerned with 
overall user interface architecture.

The simplicity principle: The design should make simple, common tasks easy, communicating clearly and simply in the user's own
language, and providing good shortcuts that are meaningfully related to longer procedures.

The visibility principle: The design should make all needed options and materials for a given task visible without distracting
the user with extraneous or redundant information. Good designs don't overwhelm users with alternatives or 
confuse with unneeded information.

The feedback principle: The design should keep users informed of actions or interpretations, changes of state or condition, 
and errors or exceptions that are relevant and of interest to the user through clear, concise, 
and unambiguous language familiar to users.

The tolerance principle: The design should be flexible and tolerant, reducing the cost of mistakes and misuse by 
allowing undoing and redoing, while also preventing errors wherever possible by tolerating varied inputs and sequences
and by interpreting all reasonable actions.

The reuse principle: The design should reuse internal and external components and behaviors, 
maintaining consistency with purpose rather than merely arbitrary consistency,
thus reducing the need for users to rethink and remember.
