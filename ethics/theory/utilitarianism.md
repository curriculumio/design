By giving my information to companies like Google and Facebook, I am effectively contributing for my extensive usage of their technology.

**Some limit:** Technology companies should be allowed to use the information they are given, but there should be limitations in place for sharing that information with others.

**Prohibit:** Technology companies should not be allowed to sell user information or violate user privacy with a profit motivation. This will limit technological development toward applications that do not require invasion of personal privacy.
