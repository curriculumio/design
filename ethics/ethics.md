The moral and ethical implications of designing arise from the understanding that how one thinks effects what one does and
what one does effects how one thinks. The primary driver of the moraland ethical perspectives that emerge through designing
is its focus on improving thecircumstances, artifacts, or practices that it addresses. The values and practices that 
designing fosters are inherently optimistic, situated, and forward looking because designing is aconstructive, situated, and 
forward looking activity. That is why designing is growing inimportance as a practical means to develop positive moral and
ethical values in face of thecircumstances of life today. A Theory of Design Thinking has direct implications for the morals,
ethics, and social behavior of those who design, and designing is open to all who think  purposefully. This paper describes h
ow specific moral and ethical values are reinforced throughthe theory. It suggests a new model for morals and ethics in the
21st century not based onreligion, tribalism, or nationalism and the guilt, shame, and contention they motivate.

Introduction
Often treated as synonyms and understood as codes that distinguish right from wrong, moralsand ethics, are treated differently
in A Theory of Design Thinking. Morals are understood asabstract beliefs and principles that constitute the character of an 
individual or that collectivelyrefer to the character of a group or community of individuals. Morals are potential responses
notyet applied to the situations that would test them. As such they abstractly indicate a range of options that anticipate 
what an individual thinker (or group) is likely to think or do whenconfronting a specific situation. The individual self 
operating from its background of knowledgeand belief is the source and agent of this morality. Edward O Wilson has noted
“True character arises from a deeper well than religion. It is the internalization of moral principles of a society,augmented 
by those tenets personally chosen by the individual, strong enough to endure throughtrials of solitude and adversity. 
The principles are fitted together into what we call integrity,literally the integrated self, wherein personal decisions 
feel good and true. Character is in turnthe enduring source of virtue. It stands by itself and excites admiration in others.”
 
Ethics, on theother hand, is understood as how morality is put into practice when the interests and perspectivesof other 
people, circumstances, and things are considered and the greater good is sought for all.Where morality builds disposition t
o seek improvement, ethics assures that the morals of individuals are fairly and justly applied to achieve the greatest good 
for all effected. Sustainableuse of resources, democratic and equitable government, and peaceful social behavior are ethical
not moral issues. The morals involved belong to those who actively consider and participate in ethical behavior. 
Although morals and ethics will sometimes be jointly referred to in whatfollows, it is advisable to keep in mind the 
distinction between them that informs this discourse.It is equally important to separate morals and ethics from their
traditional roots in religion,tribalism, and nationalism. Today, many people seek wellbeing without guilt, sin, inhibition,
andstrictures imposed by formal religions and existing social and cultural norms as they attempt torealize their dreams and 
desires, live fully, and be broadly connected to the communities of their choosing. Within this context they have less to 
guide development of their beliefs and behaviorsin a rapidly changing, sometimes meaningless, often overwhelming world.

Children, especially,need a strong moral and ethical compass to guide them as they develop and socialize in a worldwhere heavy
surveillance, ubiquitous media, artificial intelligence, and data mining may tailor their experience of the world in ways they
may not be aware of or understand.

Because it ishuman centered, purposeful, self focussing, grounded, creative, action oriented, and
requirescritical judgment and reflection designing can help children gain the confidence and competence,
the morals and ethics, to navigate an unknown future. That is why design thinking is essential totheir education.
A Theory of Design Thinking suggests that moral and ethical values are grounded in andreinforced by specific modes of 
thought that have evolved to resolve recurring aspects of experience. This places moral philosophy in the realm of 
purposeful mental functioning andemancipates it from the dogmas and narratives on which religious and cultural beliefs depend.
By affording a normative, yet open and practical, framework, design thinking provides a meansto situate and scientifically 
assess the generation and application of morals and ethics.Rejecting transcendental reasoning in favor of empiricism, 
Edward O.Wilson wrote "The generalempiricist principle takes this form: Strong innate feeling and historical experience
cause certainactions to be preferred; we have experienced them, and have weighed their consequences, and 
agree to conform with codes that express them. Let us take an oath upon thecodes, invest our personal honor in them,
and suffer punishment for their violation."

Although grounded in an evolutionary perspective the language of oaths, codes, honor and punishment are inappropriate to 
contemporary life. A more modern phrasing of empiricist principles is suggested for the proposed theory: Genes enable
capacities which develop throughnatural experience to recognize certain recurring types of information; these neural 
agenciesevolve to afford forms of cognition able to recognize, process and synthesize such information indifferent situations.
These evolved modes of thought collaborate to express thought and behavior in response to needs and desires that arise from 
different situations. Emotions, feelings, and preferences are applied to value thoughts and behaviors in each situation, 
and their consequencesinform the morals and ethics that guide us as individuals, communities, and cultures.
It is thisdefining, structuring, expressing, processing and valuing structure that affords the possibility toanalyze,
compare and develop what we believe and do in different circumstances.


 
An evolved system of cognitive agents that address different aspects of a problematic situationthrough a collaborative 
framework to arrive at a designed resolution and its cognitive andcultural assimilation is proposed. 
The components and structure of A Theory of Design Thinkingafford a practical approach that can facilitate the
emergence and development of moral andethical thought when designing. The theory posits an emotional basis for different 
modes of thought, the philosophical stances they manifest, and the moral and ethical implications for eachmode. 
Human feelings, thought, and behavior are given a purposeful framework in which toexperience, and express 
what it is to think and act morally and ethically within a systematicframework applied to different situations.
The rich, complex, and adaptive nature of moral andethical consideration is evident as modes of thought collaborate
to resolve, express, and apply purposeful thought. The structure of the theory also affords the possibility for 
analysis of howmorals and ethics develop and are applied. The intentional thought and behavior of individualsas
well as the collective judgments of communities, societies and cultures are given a practicalempirical framework.
Moral and ethical values arise through personal experiences, their situated interpretation,evaluation, and assimilation. 
These values vary with individuals, disciplines and cultures. Theycan be implicit or explicit in the reasons for designing 
and in the choices made during design.Whether tacitly held or abstractly apprehended through language, communication and 
theassimilation of knowledge, circumstances, beliefs, habits, intentions, and values shape theexperiences 
we have and how they are understood. Design thought and action influences how theissues involved are understood, addressed,
and transformed. Moral, ethical, social and culturalvalues are positively expressed, and instrumentally suited to the 
subjects and situations to whichthey are applied. Tacitly held values are made explicit to communicate what we think and do.
While declarations of intent try to establish an overall understanding and justify whether a design project is worthwhile, 
they seldom contain explicit moral and ethical guidance for thought or  behavior. Relating values to modes of thought 
can make them explicit and provide positiveguidance to our intentions.What then are the moral and ethical implications 
of “A Theory of Design Thinking” and thevalues identified with each mode of thought? 
The values of Responsibility, Referential accuracy,Goodness of fit, Appropriate expression, Effectiveness, Fairness, and 
Wellbeing are suggested asthe modern moral and ethical values that designing encourages. These principles avoid the burden 
of guilt that traditional moral and ethical principles arising from tribalism, nationalismand religion (such as honor, 
patriotism, shame, humility, remorse and redemption) do. Insteadthe development of self respect, empathy, compassion, 
effectiveness, conscience, and justice aregiven an operational foundation in practical and cultural experience while moral
outrage andmercy are transformed into commitments to improve the circumstances involved. While eachmode of thought in design
thinking bears a particular intentional responsibility, all modescollaborate in the pursuit and expression of a more modern 
and complex morality and ethicsgrounded in current reality
