To prototype mocks of your solutions that bring you closer to discovering a final solution. Prototyping tests how
the user interacts with your solutions. It should unveil what aspects of your solution that work and do not work.

Prototyping allows one to fail quickly while committing to few resources, to start conversations centered around user 
interactions, and to improve ideas and problem solving.

To build build prototypes, you can start with low fidelity prototypes and make your way to high fidelity prototypes. 

Low Fidelity Prototypes - do not allow user interactions usually paper based:
- Sketches 
- Wireframes
- Mockups
- Printouts
High Fidelity Prototypes - allow user interactions usually computer based:
- For devices, you can use Arduino
- Start building the foundational aspects of your solution like function
- Start putting the look and feel of your product after youâ€™ve established basic function
