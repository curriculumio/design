You see a problem that you think a device, an app, an interface would be able to solve. Where do you begin? 
To understand a problem, first research it. While researching, address the following questions. 

- Who are you solving this problem for? You or for others? 
- How do potential users interact with their environment? 
- How does this interaction give you insight about what they think and feel?
- What do they really need? 
- What values do they hold? 
- Has anybody attempted to solve this problem? If so, why were they successful or unsuccessful?

To answer these questions, in context to their daily lives, observe individuals and their behaviors. Have conversations with them and to develop their answers always ask “Why?”. Observe them complete tasks physically and have them talk to you through your steps. 

To gain a better understanding of users, you can: 
- Conduct interviews
  -  Interviews should be more of conversations. Develop answers by asking “why”
- Search the internet 
  - Read news articles, academic articles 
  - Use the advanced search
  

“To create meaningful innovations, you need to know your users and care about their lives.”
