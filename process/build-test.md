Building and Testing 

Now that you’ve built multiple prototypes, determine what made each one successful and try to put together a tentative
final solution. After building your solution, test it out with users. Does the solution answer the questions and 
solve the problem? If it does great! 

If it does not, try to answer these following questions: 
- Did the tentative final solution at least address part of the problem statement? 
- Did it solve another solution instead?
- In which aspects did it not solve part of the problem statement? 

From observing the user interaction, at which stage in design process did you make assumptions about the user and their needs? 
After you go through these questions, determine which stage you should go back to and work forward from? If you keep all
your prototypes, you won’t have to start from scratch! You’ll just have to tinker with them to fit a more appropriate prototype. 
Repeat the process until you derive the final solution. Wax on, Wax Off.
