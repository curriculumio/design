The next step is to generate potential solutions to your problem statement. Eventually these ideas will be the source of 
inspiration for your prototypes and providing solutions for your users. You will combine your understanding of the problem
with your imagination to create solutions. Although the eventual goal is to find the best solution, you will not
know what the best solution is until you go through user testing and feedback. 


To discover the full range of solutions, you can: 
- Brainstorm 
  - Identify key questions that you are now concerned about solving and do a simple brainstorm. Focus on 
   generating solutions as fast as possible, even they do not entirely make sense
- Journey Map 
  - This activity allows you to identify and strategize for key moments in the product,
  experience, or service you’re designing
- Mission Impossible
  - To truly create something innovative and do-able, we must challenge constraints. In this activity, 
  your team will take a design, process, system, or idea related to your problem and change one 
  foundational aspect to make it “impossible” in function or feasibility. This activity works well for thinking 
  through assumptions and obstacles to reimagine solution
