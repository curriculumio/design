Design Lab 1: Tower of Spaghetti

In this Design Thinking challenge, the goal is to build the highest possible tower with the following material in 20 minutes:

- 20 stics of spaghetti
- one yard tape 
- one yard string 
- one marshmallow 

The rules of the challenge are:
- You cannot break the spaghetti sticks 
- A marshmallow had to be attached to the top of the tower

When you first start, the question you'll encounter is should I start planning or building? This experiment validates our 
assumptions and practices the value of iterations. Once you finish the challenge ask the following questions to your self:

- Should I have or have not put an emphasis on planning?
- What could I have done to improve the model of the design? 
- Was it valuable getting feedback at an earlier stage?
- Did the feedback effectively change your approach? If so, how?
