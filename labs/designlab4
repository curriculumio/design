In this design exercise, the “nine dots” problem 3 is used to explore 		
unexpected “out-of-the-box” solutions to a problem.

Materials: 
- paper 
- pen

Draw a dots in a 3 x 3 fashion like this 

* * *
* * *
* * *

With yout pen, first connect the three rows of three dots in each row with five connected 		
straight lines, then with four, then with three, and finally with one.

For the last problem, try folding the paper.

These kind of problems help introduce the “no right answer” to a problem. 

For example, use all five numbers: 2, 3, 5, 10, 24 and any mathematical 		
operations that they choose to make up the number 120. The problem has many 			
solutions, for example: (10-5)*24/(3-2)=120, or (10-5)(3-2)*24=120.
