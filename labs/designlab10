In this design lab, apply knowledge of LEDs and Arduinos to build and prototype a device that solves a real world problem. 

Materials:
- Arduino Board
- LEDs
- USB Cord 
- Breadboard
- Wires 
- Resistors 

Instructions:
- Brainstorm problems
- Pick problem 
- Brainstorm Solutions
- Build Prototype 
- Test Prototype 

Try to build your Arduino to scale. For instance, if you want to make a path that lights up to your house, build a mock house 
that has an LED path go up to it! You can find other uses like a lamp or a motion a sensor light!
