Have you ever pulled on a door when it requires a push? Mapping is concerned with the relationships between controls and
their effects in the world. If the door handle that had sticker that said push, the user would know which action to pursue 
in order to successfully open the door.


Looking back at the Gene Lab website, users can clearly follow a direction and access a multitude of content. Click on the
about section on left handed menu. As you scroll down and read the about section, pay attention to the menu above. 
The heading of the page remains static and tells you where you are in the content. This is a great interactive menu 
that not only tells the user where they are in the content, but broadly communicates Gene Lab.
