An affordance refers to attributes of an object that allows people to know how to use it.If you look at a computer mouse, it 
signals to push the mouse button. An affordance is much like a clue of how to use an object.

The tea pot below has a handle that signals the user to place their hand through the opening of the handle then wrap it around.

What are some affordances on the site? What was the first thing you clicked on? What signified you to click? There are many 
arrows and prompts (like “Watch Story”) that clue users into where these actions will take them.
