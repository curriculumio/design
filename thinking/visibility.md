Imagine driving at night down a highway, you look at your dashboard and it is lit with a neon orange hue. It indicates your speed, amount of gas, engine temperature, and revolutions per minute (RPM). Now imagine driving at night down a highway, and you can’t see your dashboard. There’s no feature that illuminates the indicators that matter for driving safety. How can you tell how fast you’re going? What about fuel?


Visibility allows one to see the state of the device and possible actions.  Car controls are easily positioned to be found and used. If they were out of sight, it would make them more difficult to find and know how use.

“The goal of a designer is to listen, observe, understand, sympathize, empathize, synthesize, and glean insights that enable him or her to ‘make the invisible visible.’ – Hillman Curtis
