Much like building computer programs, math, and science are based on principles, designing interfaces nad devices are
also based on a set of principles. Don Norman, who can be heralded as the father of modern design, outlines criteria
that good design, outlines criteria that good design should have these elements: visibility, feedback, constraints, mapping,
consistency, and affordance. If everyday objects can satisfy the critera, they are said to have usability. The usability of an
object is an attribute that defines how easy it is to use an object. 

Let's define these principles and see how they work together to make design effective, meaningful, and enjoyable. 

"I think there is a tendency in science to measure what is measurable and to decide that what you cannot measure must be uninteresting."
-Don Norman
