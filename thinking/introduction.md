Much like building computer programs, math, and science are based on principles, designing interfaces nad devices are
also based on a set of principles. Don Norman, who can be heralded as the father of modern design, outlines criteria
that good design, outlines criteria that good design should have these elements: visibility, feedback, constraints, mapping,
consistency, and affordance. If everyday objects can satisfy the critera, they are said to have usability. The usability of an
object is an attribute that defines how easy it is to use an object. 

Let's define these principles and see how they work together to make design effective, meaningful, and enjoyable. 

"Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep undersatnding of the person with whom the designer is communicating." - Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things
