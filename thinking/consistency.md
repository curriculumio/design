Consistency separates unpolished experiences from polished ones. When designing interfaces, operations should use similar
elements for achieving similar tasks. Can you find an example of consistency on the Nasa Gene Site? When you scroll through
the site, the content layout remains the same and the side menu remains static as you scroll. 

When interacting with the various features, theyâ€™re motions are fluid. The overall experience gives a sensation of lightness, 
space, and curiosity.

Physical interfaces that show consistency are stop lights. Their meanings and actions are consistent.
For any new driver, they improve learnability and understanding of when to stop, slow down, and accelerate. 
The consistent use of symbols can represent similar concepts, such as the hexagonal stop signs are red, and 
certain devices use red and green to symbolize stop and play.
